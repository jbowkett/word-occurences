<![CDATA[
<p>By <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/author/a2m-capital" title="A2M Capital LLC">A2M Capital LLC</a></p> <p>U.S. stock prices have displayed a distinct trading pattern in the last two years. Since the beginning of 2013, the S&amp;P 500 Index has found support after low-volatility sell-offs

<![CDATA[
at its 100-day moving average (100 DMA).</p> <p>This line of support has been acting as a springboard for sharp moves higher as a result of short covering by various market participants, who were expecting a deeper correction.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40923" src="http://investing.cove

<![CDATA[
stor.com/content/2014/10/bull-market-losing-steam-in-october.png" alt="bull-market-losing-steam-in-october" width="450" height="326" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This pattern has occurred seven times during this recent low volatility period. Now, the stock market rally is looking a little parched.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Changing winds</h3> <p>To be honest, we found ourselves on the short side as well in some of these situations, which is one of the reasons why the <a href="http://covestor.com/a2m-capital/technical-swing">Technical Swing portfolio</a> underperformed during the last year.</p> <p>The question is how long will the 100 DMA pattern keep on working. There are reasons to believe that the environment has changed and the support line could fail.</p> <p>One reason to be cautious is the fact that the pattern has become too obvious for everybody. <strong>Markets have a tendency to surprise the maximum number of people.</strong></p> <p>It is a law of market efficiency that obvious patterns have to defeat themselves once everybody tries to trade them.</p> <p>It is impossible to predict when patterns stop to work. However, markets are probabilistic, so t<strong>he chance that the S&amp;P 500 will not find support at the 100 DMA is decreasing over time.</strong></p> <p>Another way to evaluate patterns is to simply try to find out if the market environment has changed by analyzing intermarket relationships.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Throttle back</h3> <p>If the environment changes, it might make sense to be less aggressive. Chart 1 shows the S&amp;P 500, the US Dollar Index ETF<a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/uup"> (UUP)</a> and <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/ezu">(EZU)</a>, a European stocks ETF for the last two years.</p> <div id="attachment_40918" style="width: 374px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-40918" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/AROLD-Chart-1.png" alt="100 DMA" width="364" height="582" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Click to Enlarge</p></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Almost the entire period can be characterized by an environment, where the U.S. dollar was declining and European stocks moved in sync with US equity markets.</p> <p>But something changed in the last months:<strong> in July, the Greenback started to rise shapely and Europe went into a deeper correction, thus decoupling from American stocks.</strong></p> <p>We don&#8217;t care, why the environment is different. The fact that it has changed tells us to be careful  with patterns that worked in the past.</p> <p>In addition, US stocks have been flashing a big warning sign for over a year: fewer and fewer stocks have been participating in the rally.</p> <p>Chart 2 shows the number of S&amp;P 500 stocks at new 52 week highs. <strong>As one can see, the rally was a healthy one until the mid of 2013.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div id="attachment_40919" style="width: 366px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-40919" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/AROLD-Chart-2.png" alt="technical-stock-chart" width="356" height="520" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Click to Enlarge</p></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But since then, the number of participating stocks has been declining. We wrote about this phenomenon in earlier reports. It is impossible to exactly time the market using this indicator.</p> <p><strong>Yet, historically, major market tops have been preceded by fewer participating stocks.</strong></p> <p>So what does this all mean? Unless new bullish signs emerge, this is not the time to load up on equities. Markets are currently oversold, so sharp rallies could happen any days.</p> <p><strong>Chances are they will be short-lived in my opinion.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><br /> <span id="hs-cta-wrapper-d35c314d-234a-4afd-8b0d-7fc75bf8873c" class="hs-cta-wrapper"><br /> <span id="hs-cta-d35c314d-234a-4afd-8b0d-7fc75bf8873c" class="hs-cta-node hs-cta-d35c314d-234a-4afd-8b0d-7fc75bf8873c"><br /> <!-- [if lte IE 8]></p> <div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div> <p><![endif]--><br /> <a href="http://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/304233/d35c314d-234a-4afd-8b0d-7fc75bf8873c"><img id="hs-cta-img-d35c314d-234a-4afd-8b0d-7fc75bf8873c" class="hs-cta-img" style="border-width: 0px;" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/304233/d35c314d-234a-4afd-8b0d-7fc75bf8873c.png" alt="" /></a><br /> </span><br /> <script src="https://js.hscta.net/cta/current.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>// <![CDATA[ hbspt.cta.load(304233, 'd35c314d-234a-4afd-8b0d-7fc75bf8873c');</p> <p>// ]]&gt;</script><br /> </span><br /> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>DISCLAIMER: </i><i>The reader should not assume that any investments identified were or will be profitable or that any investment recommendations or investment decisions we make in the future will be profitable. </i><b><i>Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</i></b></p> <p class="legal">The post <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/10/technical-swing-stock-market-springboard-broken">Is this bull market running out of oomph?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://investing.covestor.com">Smarter Investing</a>

<p>By <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/author/xavier-bremner" title="Xavier Brenner">Xavier Brenner</a></p> <p>Bill Gross’s dramatic exit from the investment firm Pacific Investment Management Co. (Pimco) for Janus Capital Group (<a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/jns">JNS</a>) has led some
]]>
<![CDATA[
to conclude the era of the superstar fund manager is finished.</p> <p>At its peak, the Pimco Total Return Fund that Gross managed held $293 billion in assets back in early 2013. Now he’s gone. His departure offers up <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/10/3-lessons-investors-bill-gross-exits-pimco">useful lessons</a> about the cult of star mutual-fund manager.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40905" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/when-to-fire-your-mutual-fund-manager.jpg" alt="when-to-fire-your-mutual-fund-manager" width="450" height="338" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So what should you do when you’re concerned your fund manager has lost his or her touch? Maybe you’ve noticed your fund has been consistently underperforming its benchmark. But breaking up can be hard to do, especially if there are tax consequences for selling.</p> <p>When is it time to sack your manager? Here are three potential signs:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3><b>1) Long-term performance is inconsistent and slipping</b></h3> <p>You shouldn’t freak out if your manager is lagging an appropriate index for shorter time periods, such as monthly or quarterly. In fact, it can be counterproductive to obsessively check your portfolio.</p> <p>Yet, remember, performance is the ultimate benchmark here. <i>(See what our director of client relations thinks about </i><a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/09/right-way-wrong-way-use-past-performance"><i>how to use past performance</i></a><i>.)</i></p> <p>If your manager is consistently underperforming the market during the good years and getting crushed during the bad ones, there could be a problem. Ignoring it could be costly to your personal wealth.</p> <p>It could be time to make a move.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3><b>2) Overconfidence</b></h3> <p>Good managers exude confidence. They’ve developed a time-tested investment approach that has delivered consistent returns. Smart managers also react quickly to mistakes before they mushroom into full-blown disasters.</p> <p>Most active managers stick to established asset allocation guidelines and report to investment committees. Beware of fund managers, though, who think they are the LeBron James of investing.</p> <p>These managers can end up having a lot of autonomy, with few checks and balances. They may also resist admitting a mistake, taking the loss, and moving on.</p> <p>Confidence can sometimes turn into arrogance. And that could lead to trouble.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3><b>3) Fees are too high</b></h3> <p>Fees are understandably a controversial subject, and even more so with the rise of low-cost index funds and ETFs.</p> <p>Active managers who deliver the goods can be worth their fees. Just remember that higher fees act as a drag on returns, and raise the bar for the manager to outperform.</p> <p>And if you use a financial adviser or broker, be careful of being put into funds that charge commissions and sales fees.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>The decision to fire your mutual fund manager is an important one and shouldn’t be taken lightly.</strong> However, there are times when it just makes sense to show them the door.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i><a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/09/right-way-wrong-way-use-past-performance">Continue learning: What the investing gurus won’t tell you about past performance.</a></i></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><br /> <span id="hs-cta-wrapper-0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408" class="hs-cta-wrapper"><br /> <span id="hs-cta-0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408" class="hs-cta-node hs-cta-0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408"><br /> <!-- [if lte IE 8]></p> <div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div> <p><![endif]--><br /> <a href="http://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/304233/0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408"><img id="hs-cta-img-0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408" class="hs-cta-img" style="border-width: 0px;" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/304233/0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408.png" alt="" /></a><br /> </span><br /> <script src="https://js.hscta.net/cta/current.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>// <![CDATA[ hbspt.cta.load(304233, '0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408');</p> <p>// ]]&gt;</script><br /> </span><br /> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --></p> <p class="legal">The post <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/10/3-reasons-consider-firing-fund-manager">3 reasons to consider firing your fund manager</a> appeared first on <a href="http://investing.covestor.com">Smarter Investing</a>

As a result, the Fed intends to wait a “<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-17/fed-keeps-considerable-time-pledge-as-growth-is-moderate-.html" target="_blank">considerable time</a>” before it raises interest rates.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 Index climbed 0.6% in the quarter, setting new highs along the way. However, the quarter did not exactly end on a positive note, with the S&amp;P 500 declining 1.6% in September, and off 4.6% from the record high it set on September 19th.</p> <p>One reason for the market decline was the strengthening U.S. dollar relative to other global currencies. <strong>Investors are concerned that U.S. companies and their corporate earnings growth will be negatively impacted by a stronger dollar overseas.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div id="attachment_40889" style="width: 473px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-40889" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/EQM-1-.png" alt="US-Dollar" width="463" height="298" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Click to Enlarge</p></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>However, one residual effect of a stronger dollar is the driving down of dollar-denominated oil prices. This is a positive for industries and sectors where <strong>oil is a major input in the cost of production</strong>.</p> <p>And to the extent that lower oil prices translate into lower prices at the gas pump, this is ultimately a good thing for the consumer in my opinion.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div id="attachment_40890" style="width: 477px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-40890" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/EQM-2.png" alt="oil-price-drops" width="467" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Click to Enlarge</p></div> <h3></h3> <h3>Just right?</h3> <p>So the question going into the end of the year is this: Will economic strength at home offset weakness abroad?

The company continues to execute well and posted strong earnings results.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Buying opportunity</h3> <p>Retail names like apparel and handbag company Kate Spade <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/kate">(KATE) </a>and Zebra Technologies <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/zbra">(ZBRA)</a>, which makes barcode scanners, detracted from relative performance during the quarter.</p> <p>Kate Spade was sold toward the end of September in favor of biopharmaceutical stock Medivation <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/mdvn">(MDVN)</a>, which has a promising new drug (<a href="https://www.xtandihcp.com/" target="_blank">Xtandi</a>) to treat prostate cancer.</p> <p>Our stock selection process continues to identify growth stocks in the mid-cap segment trading at reasonable multiples. And with all the uncertainty out there going into the end of the year, the middle ground seems like a good place to fish for good opportunities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Like what you read? </strong></span></h4> <p><span style="color: #106aa7;"><strong>Subscribe to our once-weekly email newsletter and get the best posts delivered to you in one convenient place, to browse at your leisure:<br /> </strong></span><br /> <script src="//js.hsforms.net/forms/current.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>// <![CDATA[ hbspt.forms.create({ portalId: '304233', formId: '14ae20d8-6619-47b2-8c7c-a1467e6b9757' }); // ]]&gt;</script></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>DISCLAIMER: </i><i>The investments discussed are held in client accounts as of September 31, 2014.

<![CDATA[
ere are several lessons that tech investors can take away from the news.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40895" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/barbed-wire-420503_640.jpg" alt="gtat-bankruptcy-fallout" width="450" height="300" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I’ll get to a discussion about GT and its failings in a moment. But right now, I’d like you to know three things:</p> <p>1)    I don’t own GT Advanced Technology shares in the Crabtree Technology portfolio.</p> <p>2)    I’ve never owned GT Advanced Technology shares in the portfolio.</p> <p>3)    There are three reasons why it would be unlikely that a company like GT would find its way into the portfolio.</p> <p><strong>GT Advanced Technology is a New Hampshire-based company that develops and sells equipment that is, in turn, used to manufacture silicon, polysilicon (the underlying material in solar cells) and synthetic sapphire.</strong> Founded in 1994, GT recorded revenue over the past 12 months of more than $150 million.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Business unraveled</h3> <p>In late 2013, GT signed an agreement with Apple <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/aapl">(AAPL) </a>to outfit an Arizona factory with GT Advanced Technology’s equipment for the production of sapphire. After completion, the factory would be run by GT.</p> <p>While unreported at the time, the plan was for the factory to produce sapphire for the clear touchscreens on Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus handsets.</p> <p>Unfortunately for both parties, the prototype sapphire screens produced in the factory and provided to Apple didn’t have the desired attributes (better scratch resistance, in particular) the companies had been hoping for.</p> <p>The new iPhones were released in September with screens from Apple’s existing supplier Corning <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/glw">(GLW)</a> and Apple recently withheld a payment to GT. <strong>The now heavily indebted GT, lessee of a plant with no customers for its products, filed Chapter 11.</strong></p> <p>When I read the headlines about GT, I immediately looked at my quantitative model to see how well it scored. Or, in this case, didn’t score. First off, GT shares were trading at a price: sales ratio of about 10. Our hurdle is much, much lower – less than 25% of that. <strong>So it failed to pass our quant model for that reason alone.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Earnings misses</h3> <p>We don’t use a valuation hurdle for valuation; we’re not value investors. Rather, we use valuation as a proxy for fame. That’s because all things being equal, <a href="http://crabtree-am.com/wp-content/themes/crabtree-am/pdf/Fang%20Peress%20Media%20and%20Returns%20031809.pdf">less famous companies outperform</a> more famous companies. And with the luster from its association with Apple, GT was plenty famous.</p> <p>Second, I noticed that <strong>GT had fallen short of earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters.</strong> We use this measurement as a report card on how well companies are executing on their operational and financial goals.</p> <p>By itself, earnings ‘beats’ or ‘misses’ don’t say a lot. But when combined with other factors, like a company’s cash flow, it’s a strong indicator to us of how well a company can execute in the future.</p> <p>And speaking of cash flow, I noticed that in my most recent model, GT had negative operating cash flow over the last year, and negative free cash flow over that time as well. Our investors and regular readers know that we’re really big on a company’s ability to generate cash.</p> <p>Cash is the lifeblood of business. And we believe current cash flow is the strongest predictor of future cash flow. All companies selected for the Crabtree Technology model have positive operating cash flow over their most recent 12 months.</p> <p>At Crabtree, we place a very high emphasis on keeping portfolio volatility low and that means foregoing exciting stocks with sexy stories and high profile partners (example: Apple) when they don’t meet our standards.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Risk capital</h3> <p>Make no mistake: no stock in the Crabtree Technology portfolio is perfect or is immune from under-performing.</p> <p>Moreover, the news of a GT-type blow-up will affect the share prices of other, similar stocks, even the shares of companies that are performing well and in no apparent danger of a shocking development like GT’s bankruptcy. <strong>This is the stock market, after all. People are investing risk capital. We never forget that.</strong></p> <p>September was mixed for the <a href="http://covestor.com/crabtree-asset-management/crabtree-technology">Crabtree Technology portfolio</a>. The portfolio fell 2.5% in the month, much better than the 6.2% decline in the Russell 2000 Index <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Index/RUT?countrycode=US" target="_blank">(RUT)</a> but trailing slightly the -1.6% decline in the S&amp;P 500 <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Index/SPX?countrycode=US" target="_blank">(SPX) </a>benchmark.</p> <p>Our internal benchmark, the Merrill Lynch Technology 100 <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Index/MLO?countrycode=XX" target="_blank">(MLO) </a>also fell 2.5% in September. The most widely held technology ETF, the State Street Global Advisors’ Technology Select SPDR <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/symbol/xlk">(XLK)</a> fell -0.5% during the month, including the effect of a dividend.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Like what you read? </strong></span></h4> <p><span style="color: #106aa7;"><strong>Subscribe to our once-weekly email newsletter and get the best posts delivered to you in one convenient place, to browse at your leisure:<br /> </strong></span><br /> <script src="//js.hsforms.net/forms/current.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>// <![CDATA[ hbspt.forms.create({ portalId: '304233', formId: '14ae20d8-6619-47b2-8c7c-a1467e6b9757' }); // ]]&gt;</script></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>DISCLAIMER: </i><i>The investments discussed are held in client accounts as of September 31, 2014.

I&#8217;m much more interested in the interplay of valuation, liquidity and sentiment.</p> <h3></h3> <h3>Small cap rebound</h3> <p>And with the exception of sentiment (which had gotten too frothy) these &#8220;legs of the stool&#8221; continue to suggest a favorable environment for equities.</p> <p>Three times in 2014 (in February, May, and now September) the Russell 2000 small cap index has dropped to the 1090 level, and each time it has subsequently bounced back.</p> <p>In addition, according to this week&#8217;s Barron&#8217;s, in the <a href="http://online.barrons.com/news/articles/SB51517841841143733463604580192340745033582" target="_blank">17 midterm election </a>years since 1946, the S&amp;P 500 has delivered a positive return, averaging 17.5% for the twelve months measured from October 31 of the midterm year to the following October 31st.</p> <p>While neither of these factoids guarantees the same results again, I like the odds.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><br /> <span id="hs-cta-wrapper-0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408" class="hs-cta-wrapper"><br /> <span id="hs-cta-0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408" class="hs-cta-node hs-cta-0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408"><br /> <!-- [if lte IE 8]></p> <div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div> <p><![endif]--><br /> <a href="http://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/304233/0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408"><img id="hs-cta-img-0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408" class="hs-cta-img" style="border-width: 0px;" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/304233/0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408.png" alt="" /></a><br /> </span><br /> <script src="https://js.hscta.net/cta/current.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>// <![CDATA[ hbspt.cta.load(304233, '0285526a-2479-4f12-9f73-958ff18db408');</p> <p>// ]]&gt;</script><br /> </span><br /> <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --></p> <p><a href="http://campaign.covestor.com/generating-income-in-2014"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Download a free investing guide on generating income </span></em></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>DISCLAIMER: </i><i>The investments are presented for discussion purposes only and are not a reliable indicator of the performance or investment profile of any composite or client account. </i><b><i>Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</i></b></p> <p class="legal">The post <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/10/time-stop-worrying-interest-rates">Time to stop worrying about interest rates</a> appeared first on <a href="http://investing.covestor.com">Smarter Investing</a>

<p>By <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/author/sparrow-capital" title="Gerry Sparrow">Gerry Sparrow</a></p> <p>U.S. small-cap stocks have been notably weak recently and I believe some of the market volatility is due to<strong> the Federal Reserve’s conservative posture with respect to interest rates and the cutting back of bond buying activities</strong>.</p> <p>Although October has a <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/09/4-things-know-investing-october">bad reputation with investors</a>, since 1950, markets often improve between the third week of October through April the following year.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40836" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/Time-to-Buy.png" alt="Time-to-buy" width="450" height="402" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Based on these historical trends, this may be a good time to invest in my opinion.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Gas pump relief</h3> <p>I continue to be overweight stocks versus bonds because I believe most of the slowdown in economic activity has passed as lower energy prices provide consumer relief at the gas pump.</p> <p>Car buying and home purchases remain strong and though I have no way of knowing for sure this may help the markets next year.</p> <p>Looking forward, I continue to believe third quarter earnings will be solid and may be a catalyst to move the markets higher before the end of 2014.</p> <p>My investment approach with the <a href="http://covestor.com/sparrow-capital/fundamental-growth">Covestor Fundamental Growth portfolio </a>is to buy companies with consistent earning power, high return-on-equity while employing little or no long-term debt and to purchase at reasonable prices.</p> <p>I have a system that filters thousands of stocks on a weekly basis using the Sparrow multi-point checklist that screens the highest quality companies, which are then reviewed and considered for purchase in the portfolio.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/09/4-things-know-investing-october"><em>Continue learning: 4 things to know about investing in October</em></a></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/70839390@N00/">Marc Shur</a> via <a href="https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/">Flickr Creative Commons</a></em></p> <p><i>Disclaimer: </i><i>All investments involve risk and various investment strategies will not always be profitable. </i><b><i>Past performance does not guarantee future results</i></b><i>.</i></p> <p class="legal">The post <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/10/stock-declines-spell-buying-opportunity">Why October may present a buying opportunity for stocks</a> appeared first on <a href="http://investing.covestor.com">Smarter Investing</a>
